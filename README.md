## 1. Install Dependancies

Next, you need to install all the dependancies using:

```npm install```

Once this is done, you can start the app with:

```npm start```

## 2. Fill in your personal info

To populate the website with all of your own data, open the public/resumeData.json file and simply replace the data in there with your own. Images for the porfolio section are to be put in the public/images/portfolio folder.

## 3. (OPTIONAL) Replacing images and/or fonts

If you want to display your own pictures then you have to replace the files at these locations: public/images/header-background.jpg, public/images/testimonials-bg.jpg and public/favicon.ico. FILE NAMES MUST NOT BE CHANGED else the code referencing these images will no longer work.

## 4. Finalising Resume

Once all the formatting and data input is finalised, run `npm run build`. This will create a dedicated build folder.

## 5. Host Resume Online

1) Open the build folder in the finder screen
2) Go to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and set up a profile
3) Go to the 'Sites Tab'
4) Simply Drag and drop the 'Build' Folder into the designated upload space
5) The app will begin deploying & the deployment URL will be presented!

ðŸš€ BOOM, you are now LIVE!!!
